Will require WSL to be installed: `wsl --install`
Might need to also fetch a Linux distro (doesn't appear to be automatic); easily done from the Microsoft Store.
Make sure to "Open" the Linux distribution, so that it's installation completes, otherwise it won't appear in Rancher Desktop's WSL Integrations page (under preferences).
Expose the install distro from Rancher Desktop's WSL Integrations page.
